******************
Creating a Network 
******************

This section specifically focuses on those who are wanting to develop in a headless environment. If you would prefer to complete the tutorials with the use of a GUI, please follow the GUI focused guides on :ref:`gui-tutorials`.

Pre-Requisites
==============

This guide requires Docker Community Edition to be installed, this can be obtained from `here <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_

Getting Started
===============

There are a number of network designs that can be configured and run, these network designs are defined within Docker Compose files. These configuration files can be located in the ``./Docker/Docker-Compose`` directory from the below GitHub repositories.

**Standard:** https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode/tree/DeveloperEdition

**DLT:** https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode/tree/DeveloperEdition-DLT

The key difference between either repository lies within the need for determinism. In a public blockchain environment, determinism is key and ultimatley required for all participating block producers to reach consesnsus. However, within a DLT environment the behaviour of a network can be more predictable and adhere to a Leader-Follower consesnsus.

******************
Starting a Network
******************

To begin, you first need to obtain the relevant Docker Image from the following repository and clone the respective repository.

::

	git clone https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode -b DeveloperEdition

	docker pull stratisgroupltd/blockchaincovid19:latest

Once the Docker Image has been pulled, you can bring up a network of your choosing by specifying the relevant network.

::

	docker-compose -f 3-NodeNetwork.yml up

This will laucnh three nodes within their own respective containers.

::
	
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                      COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                            NAMES

``node_1`` will mine the genesis block and the pre-mine will be credited to wallet of *node_1*. Each running node can be interacted with by connecting to the respestive Swagger interface for each node. 

The forwarded port from each container will be incremented by 1 in a numerical order. This is also evident when listing docker containers via the command line under the "Ports" header.

Interacting with the Network
============================

Once the network is running, you can interact with each node via RESTFul API that is presented by the node. The available endponints are documented on the :ref:`developers-api` page.
