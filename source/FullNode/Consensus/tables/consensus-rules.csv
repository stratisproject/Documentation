Rule,Description
Bitcoin Activation,Checks that the block is a new enough version for any active deployments the network has upgraded to. 
Bitcoin Header Version,Does nothing currently. Any block version is valid for the Bitcoin network unless the Bitcoin Activation rule detects a problem.
Block Merkle Root,Checks that the block's merkle tree root matches the merkle tree root stored in the block header.
Block Size,Checks that the block's weight does not exceed the limit and that the block size in bytes is not too large. 
Check Difficulty Hybrid,Checks that the block hash (calculated using either PoW or PoS) hits the target at the required difficulty. To hit the target the hash must be less or equal to the target.
Check Difficulty PoS,Checks that the correct difficulty was used (on a PoS network) when comparing the block's hash against the target.
Check Difficulty PoW,Checks that the correct difficulty was used (on a PoW network) when comparing the block's hash against the target.
Check PoS Transaction,Checks that each transaction in a PoS block is valid.
Check PoW Transaction ,Checks that each transaction in a PoW block is valid.
Check Sig Ops,Checks that the block does not have too many signature check operations.
Coinbase Height Activation,Check that the block's height is serialized in the script language if `BIP34 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki>`_ is being enforced.
Ensure Coinbase,Checks that the block has the required single coinbase transaction.
Header Time Checks,Checks that the block timestamp is greater then the consensus tip timestamp and not more than two hours in the future.
Header Time Checks PoA,Checks that a PoA block timestamp is greater than the previous block's timestamp is not too far in the future and is a valid timeslot which respects the target spacing. 
Header Time Checks PoS,Checks that a PoS block timestamp is greater than the previous block's timestamp.
Load Coin View,Checks that the value the block has stored for the previous block's hash matches the hash of the consensus tip's block. Next it loads the UTXO set for the block.
PoA Coinview,Checks the UTXO set from a PoA perspective.
PoA Header Difficulty,Checks that a PoA block has specific difficulty which is common across all blocks on a PoA network.
PoA Header Signature,Checks that a PoA block is signed with the expected federation member's public key  (based on the timeslot it was written in).
PoA Integrity Signature,Checks that a PoA block's signature matches the signature of the header used to intiate its download.
PoS Block Signature,Checks that the signature for a PoS block is valid.
PoS Block Signature Representation,Checks that the signature for a PoS block is in the canonical format.
PoS Coinstake,Checks that a PoS block contains a single coinstake transaction has no coinbase transaction and has no transactions with a timestamp after the block timestamp.
PoS Coinview,Checks the UTXO set from a PoS perspective including stake checking.
PoS Coldstaking,Checks a PoS block to see if the coinstake transaction is cold and if so performs checks to see whether the transaction is a valid cold coinstake.  
PoS Time Mask,"Checks that a PoS block coinstake transaction's timestamp matches the block timestamp and that the timestamp is divisible by 16 seconds. A time of 16 seconds applies for the Stratis mainchain although this can be customized, without adjusting the rule, for another blockchain."
PoW Coinview,Checks that the UTXO set from a PoW block's transactions contain correctly spent inputs and correctly created new outputs.   
Proven Header Coinstake,Checks that the coinstake transaction supplied with a proven header is valid.
Proven Header Size,Checks that a proven header's serialized components are not greater than the maximum size permitted.
Save Coinview,Saves the changes made to the coinview if required.
Set Activation Deployment Full Validation,Not a rule. Sets an instance of ``RulesContext.Flags`` with the deployments that have been activated. These flags are then queried when other full validation rules are checked.
Set Activation Deployment Partial Validation,Not a rule. Sets an instance of ``RulesContext.Flags`` with the deployments that have been activated. These flags are then queried when other partial validation rules are checked.
Stratis Bug Fix PoS Future Drift,Makes sure that the block timestamp is not more than 15 seconds in the future. Also protects against a the effects of a bug that has now been fixed. 
Stratis Header Version,Checks that the block version is valid for the Stratis network.
Transaction Duplication Activation,Checks that the block does not contain duplicate transactions.
Transaction Locktime Activation,Checks that the block's transactions are all finalized using a median of the last 11 blocks instead of the block's timestamp.
Witness Commitments,Checks that witness commitments for the block are expected and valid.
