**Call Contract Summary**

**Sender:** CckErAtdqkxx1ZLRmRj4akE9r9H8s8szw4

  This is the selected address that is interacting with the Smart
  Contract.

**Amount:** 0

  We are not sending any funds, we are interacting with a Smart Contract.

**Fee:** 0.001

  This is the default fee and can be left as default value

**Gas Price:** 100

  This is the default Gas Price and can be left as default value

**Gas Limit:** 50000

  This is the default Gas Price and can be left as default value

**Parameters**:

**Address**: CckErAtdqkxx1ZLRmRj4akE9r9H8s8szw4

   This parameter defines where, if successful, the requested funds will
   be distributed to. Ensure that this is an owned address.

**ULong**: 1000000000000

   This parameter defines that requested funding from the Stratis
   Decentralized Accelerator. In this example, we are requesting 10,000 CRS
   (in a 'satoshi' format)

**UInt**: 27000

   This parameter defines the length of the proposal vote. The value is
   defined in 'blocks'. This value can be determined using the below
   formula.

   *Seconds per Day (86,400) / Cirrus Block Time (16) \* Days (5)*

   The above result ensures that the proposal vote remains active for at
   least 5 days.

   It is important to note that requested amounts will not be released until
   the proposal length has passed. i.e. If a proposal recieves 51% of IDGB voting 
   in favour within the first 24hr, but the proposal length is set to 5 days the 
   proposal cannot be executed until the 5th day has passed.

**String**: Test Proposal

  This parameter defines a brief description of the proposal.

**Method Name:** CreateProposal

  This is the Smart Contract method that we are interacting with to create
  a proposal.

**Contract Address:** CbtYboKjnk7rhNbEFzn94UZikde36h6TCb

  This is the mainnet Stratis Decentralized Accelerator Smart Contract Address. The
  address defined here should not be used for creating production proposals.

**Wallet Password:** \******\*

  This is your wallet password.
