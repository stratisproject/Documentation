Token Swap 
##########

As the initial Token Swap window has now come to a close, as highlighted in our original announcement, Stratis can now only be exchanged via a new Token Swap process. Two documents have been created to support STRAT Token Holders in performing the Token Swap.

A high-level summary of the process can be found below.

1. Install STRAX Wallet and generate an address
2. Run Stratis Address Ownership Tool
3. Provide the Tool with Wallet Detail and new STRAX Address
4. Upload the produced CSV

The Address Ownership Tool obtains a list of addresses, associated with your wallet and creates a unique signature. This signature is signed using your wallet, providing unequivocal proof that you are the owner of the provided address. All relevant detail is saved to a CSV file that you must upload using this page. STRAT Token addresses are then queried for their balance at the time of the snapshot, taken at 9AM on the 12th November 2020.

If you haven't already, download the `STRAX Wallet <https://www.stratisplatform.com/wallets/>`_ and create your new STRAX Wallet and retrieve an address. 

You can then review and follow the steps outlined in the below operation guides, relevant to the wallet you have that contains Stratis Tokens and the platform you're running. i.e. MacOS or Windows.
